        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
          Before I ever wrote code, my career was about caring for people at
          their most vulnerable. At 17, I started working in a care agency,
          learning quickly what responsibility really meant. I moved into
          private care supporting people with high-need disabilities, where
          patience, adaptability, and empathy were essential.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, I spent time in elderly care as an activity coordinator,
          bringing moments of joy, routine, and dignity through events and daily
          engagement. Eventually, I moved fully into medical care, becoming a
          senior carer across multiple nursing homes. I was responsible for
          overseeing the day to day care of up to 30 residents at a time,
          leading staff, coordinating healthcare tasks, and making decisions
          that directly affected people's wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p>
          My final chapter in healthcare was with the NHS, where I spent three
          years working across A&E, Medical Assessment, mental health, and
          disability services. It was intense, demanding, and deeply human work
          that taught me resilience, clear communication, and how to stay calm
          when things matter most.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working within such a mentally demanding environment made me realise I
          needed a break, so I decided to change career to see if something
          completely different might be right for me. I taught myself how to
          code and went on to become a full stack engineer at a price comparison
          website. I enjoy the work, but something has always felt missing.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I miss are the deeply human moments, the feeling of helping
          people directly, from all walks of life, and all manner of
          disabilities. So now, I'm bringing both careers together. By combining
          my background in healthcare with my expertise in frontend development,
          my goal is to specialise in accessibility and building digital
          experiences that work for everyone.
