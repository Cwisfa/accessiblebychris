            <h2>My Accessibility Journey</h2>
            <p><strong>March 2014 - February 2022</strong> - Worked directly with people with mental and physical disabilities across care homes, the community and within the NHS. Learned about how accessibility barriers affect real people in their daily lives.</p>
            <p><strong>February 2022 - August 2025</strong> - Taught myself to code and made a career switch, landed an
                apprenticeship as a full stack engineer. I worked within front end focused, iOS development and full
                stack teams.</p>
            <p><strong>September 2025 - present</strong> -  Started focusing on web accessibility and became Accessibility Champion for my team. Attended AbilityNet TechShare 2025 and began studying for the CPACC and WAS
                certifications simultaneously. Began to audit my teams internal tools for practice and fun. Created this website. Presented my first accessibility talk to my team.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Before I ever wrote code, my career was about caring for people at their most vulnerable. At 17, I
                started working in a care agency, learning quickly what responsibility really meant. I moved into
                private care supporting people with high-need disabilities, where patience, adaptability, and empathy
                were essential.</p>

            <p>From there, I spent time in elderly care as an activity coordinator, bringing moments of joy, routine,
                and dignity through events and daily engagement. Eventually, I moved fully into medical care, becoming a
                senior carer across multiple nursing homes. I was responsible for overseeing the day to day care of up
                to 30 residents at a time, leading staff, coordinating healthcare tasks, and making decisions that
                directly affected people's wellbeing.</p>

            <p>My final chapter in healthcare was with the NHS, where I spent three years working across A&E, Medical
                Assessment, mental health, and disability services. It was intense, demanding, and deeply human work
                that taught me resilience, clear communication, and how to stay calm when things matter most.</p>

            <p>Working within such a mentally demanding environment made me realise I needed a break, so I decided to
                change career to see if something completely different might be right for me. I taught myself how to
                code and went on to become a full stack engineer at a price comparison website. I enjoy the work, but
                something has always felt missing.</p>

            <p>What I miss are the deeply human moments, the feeling of helping people directly, from all walks of life,
                and all manner of disabilities. So now, I'm bringing both careers together. By combining my background
                in healthcare with my expertise in frontend development, my goal is to specialise in accessibility and
                building digital experiences that work for everyone.</p>
