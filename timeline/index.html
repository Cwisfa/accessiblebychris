            <h2>My Accessibility Journey</h2>
            <p><strong>March 2014 - February 2022</strong> - Worked directly with people with mental and physical disabilities across care homes, the community and within the NHS. Learned about how accessibility barriers affect real people in their daily lives.</p>
            <p><strong>February 2022 - August 2025</strong> - Taught myself to code and made a career switch, landed an
                apprenticeship as a full stack engineer. I worked within front end focused, iOS development and full
                stack teams.</p>
            <p><strong>September 2025 - present</strong> -  Started focusing on web accessibility and became Accessibility Champion for my team. Attended AbilityNet TechShare 2025 and began studying for the CPACC and WAS
                certifications simultaneously. Began to audit my teams internal tools for practice and fun. Created this website. Presented my first accessibility talk to my team.</p>
